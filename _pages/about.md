Hi! Iâ€™m Yingtao, a Phd candidate at the University technology of Sydney in the School of Computer Science, under the guidance of [Professor CT Lin](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Chin-Teng.Lin). I enjoy playing basketball and am a big fan of the Golden State Warriors. I also love to spend time daydreaming by the sea. My research interests include fuzzy theory, recommendation systems and machine learning. If you are interested in my research work, feel free to contact me anytime(ytren.ai@outlook.com). I would be delighted to have a cup of my favorite black tea with you!
